**Site-PSTN-Conversion-Questionnaire.xlsx** - A list of discovery questions one might need for assessing a site for a PSTN upgrade. This is meant to be filled out as completely as possible for each site to be upgraded (or migrated). Only the most meticulous site administrator would be able to properly fill this entire questionnaire though. So this should be used as a starting point for conversation around the needs for a particular site.

**Voice-Upgrade-Workbook.xlsx** - A general purpose workbook for tracking multiple sites. 

**Deployment Phases.vsdx** - A multiple sheet visio diagram simplifying the stages of a Skype for Business enterprise voice deployment.
